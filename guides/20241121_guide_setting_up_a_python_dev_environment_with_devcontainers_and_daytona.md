## Overview of Dev Containers

Dev Containers, short for Development Containers, are a way to configure portable
and reproducible development environments using Docker containers. Dev containers
are isolated, lightweight environments that allow developers to work inside a
containerized version of a build environment.

**Key Features of Dev Containers:**

- **Pre-configured Build Environments**: Dev containers come with a base image that has all the software, tools, and dependencies pre-installed, so you can get started coding right away.
- **Isolated Environments**: Each dev container has its own isolated filesystem, networking, memory, and CPU, so there are no conflicts with other projects or software on your local machine.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Dev containers provide the exact same environment every time they're launched, ensuring consistent build results. No more "it works on my machine!" issues.
- **Less Setup Time**: Starting a new project with dev containers means you can skip the lengthy setup and configuration process. Just open your project in the container and everything is ready to go.
- **Flexibility**: You can choose a base image with the software and tools you want or build your own custom base image, meeting your specific needs.

## Step 1: Preparations

### Fork the Template Repository

Weâ€™ll use this [pthon-project-template](https://github.com/pamelafox/python-project-template),
which includes a basic `main.py` and tests in `tests/main_test.py`. Refer to the `README` for
details on the project structure.

Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create a local copy
under your GitHub account.

The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file content defines a configuration for a python
development container environment.

```json
{
  "name": "Python 3",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11-bullseye",
  "customizations": {
      "vscode": {
          "settings": {
              "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
              "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
              "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
              "files.exclude": {
                  ".coverage": true,
                  ".pytest_cache": true,
                  "__pycache__": true
              }
          },
          "extensions": [
              "ms-python.python",
              "charliermarsh.ruff",
              "ms-python.black-formatter"
          ]
      }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "git config --global --add safe.directory ${containerWorkspaceFolder}",
  "postStartCommand": "pip3 install --user -r requirements-dev.txt && pre-commit install",
  "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```
Let's breakdown the `devcontainer.json` file.

- **name**: Specifies the name of the development environment.
- **image**: Points to the Docker image used for the container, `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11-bullseye`, a Python 3.11 environment based on Debian Bullseye.
- **customizations**: Allows customization of the development environment, specifically for Visual Studio Code.
- **vscode**: AContains VS Code-specific configurations.
- **settings**: Defines default VS Code settings for the container.
- **python.defaultInterpreterPath**: Specifies the Python interpreter path inside the container (`/usr/local/bin/python`).
- **python.testing.pytestEnabled**: Enables the use of `pytest` for testing.
- **python.testing.unittestEnabled**: Disables unittest as the testing framework.
- **files.exclude**: Hides specified files and folders (e.g., `.coverage`, `.pytest_cache`, `__pycache__`) from the VS Code file explorer.
- **extensions**: Lists extensions to be installed automatically in the container.
- **ms-python.python**: Python language support for VS Code.
- **charliermarsh.ruff**: A Python linter.
- **ms-python.black-formatter**: Formatter for Python code using Black.
- **postCreateCommand**: Configures Git to recognize the container workspace folder as safe ("git config --global --add safe.directory ${containerWorkspaceFolder}").
- **postStartCommand**: Installs Python packages from requirements-dev.txt ("pip3 install --user -r requirements-dev.txt") and sets up pre-commit hooks ("pre-commit install").
- **remoteUser**: sets `vscode` as the non-root default user.

By including a `devcontainer.json` file in your project repository, you can specify not just
the Python version and dependencies, but also any required system packages, VS Code extensions,
environment variables, and even custom scripts to run during setup.

## Step 2: Main Process

### Step 2.1: Start Daytona Server

Start the daytona server by running the command.

```bash
daytona server
```

Your output should be similar to the screenshot below.

### Step 2.4 Create a Daytona Workspace

Now create a dev environment of the repository you created in GitHub(by forking) and
follow the prompts after you run it.

```bash
daytona create
```

Choose Github as a provider and select the python-project-template repository.

#### Step 2.4.1 Provide workspace name

The name of the workspace is usually the repository name if you didn't modify it when
prompted in the creation of the workspace. In my case, it's `python-project-template`

![workspace name](assets/setting_up_a_python_dev_environment_with_devcontainers_and_daytona_img6.png)

#### Step 2.4.2 Choose the target

Now it will ask you to choose the target, select `local`, and enter.

![Choose the target ](assets/setting_up_a_python_dev_environment_with_devcontainers_and_daytona_img7.png)

Daytona will now start creating a workspace by pulling your project and installing all
required dependencies, once done it will open your project in your default IDE.

![Daytona workspace](assets/setting_up_a_python_dev_environment_with_devcontainers_and_daytona_img9.png)

Now, your Python dev environment is ready to use.

### Step 3: Confirmation

In your VS Code, run the test cases using the command below, and you will see all the test cases passed.
This means the Python dev environment has successfully set for your project.

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```
